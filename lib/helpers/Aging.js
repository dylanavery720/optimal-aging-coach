    <h1>Aging Conversation</h1>
    <h2>{`The whole world is getting older. Japan is arguably the oldest country with almost 1 in 4 citizens over the age of 65. Monaco’s percentage is higher but the tiny principality doesn’t count as its numbers are skewed by retired rich folks from elsewhere. The U.S., with 13.3% of its people over the age of 65, doesn’t even make the top 10 list: We’re number eleven. More than 10,000 U.S. citizens turn 65 every day! Baby Boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, today number 76 million people. In Colorado, 11.3% are over 65 years of age.
I’m not a betting man, but I bet that everyone reading this column is getting older. The implications of the demographics are staggering, including the macro-economic, the micro-economic, the environmental, our families and the deeply personal.`}</h2>

<h2>{`As a Gerontologist, I want to explore the many and profound implications of our aging population. The Editor of Prime Time for Seniors has kindly provided me an opportunity to contribute a monthly column. It’s my hope that, after establishing the general context of how many grey-haired individuals walk among us, to fully and deeply explore the challenges, the opportunities, the available resources and most importantly, how we can best navigate the last stages of our lives with deep meaning, a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment, and remain healthy contributing members in our families, our neighborhoods and our country.`}</h2>

<h2>{`We’ve seen many world-changing events and inventions in our lives. There will be many more exciting discoveries. Advances in medicine alone have certainly contributed to our aging society. Life expectancy has risen from 31 years in the early 20th century to almost 70 years today!  There have been and will continue to be changes in both how we live, and how we die. For example, in the United States, only 7 states have decriminalized assisted suicide. Some in the Netherlands now want to extend that nation’s legalized euthanasia -from the Greek meaning "good death" the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering.  There, people over age 70 would be eligible for voluntary euthanasia even if they’re not suffering from an illness. They need only be “suffering from life,” a category that is very broad, indeed. The proposal certainly underscores personal choice as a highly valued component of a person’s life.`}</h2>

<h2>{`The most often heard standard of measurement in discussions of late life is something called “Quality of Life.”  It’s generally accepted that what is most important in an acceptable quality of life is a person’s ability to remain independent, exercise personal choice, and stay engaged with the world in meaningful and rewarding ways. This is not to be confused with “standard of living,” which is more of a wealth-based measurement. As we all know having listened to The Beatles, money “Can’t Buy Me Love”.`}</h2>

<h2>{`Allow me to tell you my personal story. I was raised in eleven foster families. My mother died when I was four years old, and myself and four siblings were promptly distributed among different foster homes. Before she died, my mother had become friends with a social services worker named Margaret Riley, all four feet, 11 inches of her. Margaret promised Mom she’d take care of us kids, and did she ever! I was raised in all-Catholic homes. I was an altar boy by the age of eight, learned my Latin and assisted the Monsignor at Mass.`}</h2>

<h2>{`One cold northern-Wisconsin day, while walking through a snowstorm, I found myself crying and praying. I had been learned that morning that I was to be moved again. My siblings and I had lived with this family for five years; the longest extended period of time where I and my brother and sisters all lived together in one family. I felt happy and secure, and had many friends. I just didn’t understand why we were being separated again. (I later learned the foster father was behaving inappropriately with my oldest sister!)`}</h2>

<h2>{`As I prayed to God for help with this distressing situation, lo and behold I received an answer! A clear voice inside said to me, “Robin, I hear your call for help. I’m going to give you Three A’s to help you and guide you through your life. These Three A’s are Appreciation, Adaptability and Attitude.”`}</h2>

<h2>{`These principals have guided me throughout my life, especially appreciation. And I have found that in life, being adaptable (which I often equate with Letting Go) and approaching every situation with a positive and open attitude has been of enormous help. I think these guiding principles will help me in my old age. I hope they help you.`}</h2>

<h2>{`In future columns I’ll be exploring the Continuum of Care, from independent living through skilled care and hospice, grief work, medications, spiritual care, and the myriad of other topics that make up this wonderful journey we’re all on.
One of my favorite sayings is, “If you’re not busy living, you’re busy dying.”`}</h2>
