    <h1>Medications, Hospitals and the Good Doctor</h1>
    <h2>{`Before I begin this discussion of medications, hospitals and doctors, I must beg your indulgence. When I tell someone I’m a gerontologist, more often than not there’s a blank look on their face. I’m not offended or put off by this. Gerontology is a science and a profession that most people don’t need to be familiar with. Please allow me to introduce myself and this column by providing a bit of background.`}</h2>

<h2>{`“Geron” from the Greek language means “old man” and the suffix “logy” means “study of.” The applications of this study of aging apply across a wide range of disciplines, but primarily reside in the social, psychological and biological arenas. We gerontologists are fascinated by the cycle of life, especially the latter years, and we focus much effort on understand how we can age optimally, achieve better outcomes for the many challenges that aging brings, and learn how to deal with death and the dying process – and the grief and sadness that follow.`}</h2>

<h2>{`Classically speaking, gerontologists recognize three types of aging: normal, pathological and optimal. Even normal aging (about 70% of us) has few positives. Pathological aging (about 26% of us) is no fun at all, and usually means a diagnosis and entry into the medical labyrinth. Optimal agers (about 4% of us) are rare. I will focus on optimal aging in a future column.`}</h2>

<h2>{`The normal aging process brings a decline in physical strength, endurance and flexibility. Our body’s organs become less efficient; the heart, lungs and kidneys all weaken. The elderly especially become more sensitive to medications as a result of these changes in critical body organ function.`}</h2>

<h2>{`•	Pathological aging includes these chronic maladies: Arthritis (49% of us)
	•	Hypertension (37%)
	•	Hearing Impairments (32%)
	•	Heart Disease (30%)
	•	Sinusitis (17%)
	•	Cataracts (17%)
	•	Orthopedic Impairments (16%)
	•	Diabetes (9%)
	•	Visual Impairments (9%)
	•	Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (8%) and
	•	Varicose Veins (8%).`}</h2>

<h2>{`Aging is serious business. If you are over 65 years of age, you have a one in four chance of visiting a hospital emergency room. If you’re over 65, there’s a 90% chance you’re on a prescription medication, and an 18% chance you’ll require hospitalization. You get the idea.`}</h2>

<h2>{`Each year in the U.S., almost 100,000 people over the age of 65 are admitted into a hospital because of emergencies caused by adverse drug events.  Approximately one in five prescriptions for elderly persons in primary care is inappropropriate, despite the large amount of attention focused on the prescription medication issue. From my experience overseeing literally hundreds of thousands of medication “passes” as an operator of assisted-living “Care Communities,” physicians with a geriatric background or training make fewer mistakes. `}</h2>

<h2>{`If there is more than one physician prescribing drugs, make sure they know what each other is doing. If a drug is added to a person’s “med list,” I always like to see one removed. While directing assisted living facilities, if a person seeking admission has more than seven drugs on their med list, it raises red flags, typically leading to a drug regimen review. In our view, less is best. Some of our strongest and most active residents -and I’ve had hundreds under my care -were over 85 and took few, if any, medications. My wife, who also runs an assisted living care community, and I often marvel at this when discussing our work.`}</h2>

<h2>{`So what do I recommend? To me, it all starts with your physician. Does he or she have geriatric training? Unfortunately, while all medical schools have dedicated pediatric departments, a leftover from those days when all the Baby Boomers were being born, few have geriatrics departments. In 2000, there was one pediatrician for every 935 children, but only one geriatrician for every 3,888 elderly people. By some estimates, we’ll need some 30,000 additional geriatricians over the next 30 years. Academic, government and community leaders and organizations must include ensuring enough geriatricians are trained in their list of priorities for the future. `}</h2>

<h2>{`Care, not treatment, is the better way. Treating chronic diseases with hospitalizations, surgery and drugs is not only becoming less effective, it is becoming dangerous for some. Proper diet, exercise, and lifestyle are the keys to remaining or becoming healthy. There are dietary, environmental, genetic, and lifestyle causes for our disabilities, but understanding the underlying emotional and spiritual causes behind chronic disease is also important as our medical paradigm evolves.`}</h2>
