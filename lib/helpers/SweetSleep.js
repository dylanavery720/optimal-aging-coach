    <h1>Sweet Sleep</h1>
    <h2>{`“Early to sleep and early to rise makes a man health, wealthy and wise.” says the 1735 edition of Poor Richard's Almanack. Not surprisingly, it’s often attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who was 29 years old at the time.

The following story repeats itself over and over as families look for an assisted living community. My Mom lives alone and isn’t doing well. My Dad died a few years ago, and Mom is been getting more frail. The doctor doesn’t think it’s safe for her to remain in the family home. It started about a year ago. Mom’s confusion has seemed to increase, and she just isn’t herself. She isn’t eating well. She isn’t sleeping well, and would be up and down through the night. `}</h2>

<h2>{`It turns out that not sleeping well, also called Sleep Apnea, can be the cause of many other ailments best avoided.
The most common signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, episodes of breathing cessation while sleeping, abrupt awakenings accompanied by shortness of breath, awakening with a dry mouth or sore throat, morning headache, or difficulty staying asleep.
Most people probably don't think of snoring as serious, and not everyone who has sleep apnea snores. However, the negative effects of sleep problems shouldn’t be ignored. As always, prevention is the better part of cure. The truth is that sleep problems can have serious effects on both the length of our life, but most certainly its quality. Sleep Apnea can cause high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, diabetes, depression, and other ailments, not to mention automobile accidents caused by falling asleep at the wheel. It affects more than 18 million Americans, according to the National Sleep Foundation.`}</h2>

<h2>{`Some causes of sleep disturbances in older adults include Alzheimer's disease, chronic disease, congestive heart failure, depression (depression is a common cause of sleep problems in people of all ages) neurological conditions, pain caused by diseases such as arthritis, prescription drugs, recreational drugs, or alcohol, an overly sedentary lifestyle doesn’t help, and neither does stimulants such as caffeine, or having urination problems through the night.
`}</h2>

<h2>{`Relieving chronic pain and controlling medical conditions such as frequent urination may improve sleep in some people. Treating depression can be very effective to improve sleep. Other ways to improve sleep include following healthy lifestyles like getting regular exercise early in the day, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. You may not like this, but daytime naps are generally discouraged. Use the bed only for sleep or sex. Avoid large meals shortly before bedtime, and avoid alcohol in excess like the plague. If you can't fall asleep relatively quickly after going to bed, say a half hour, get out of bed and do a quiet activity such as reading or listening to soft music. Learning meditation and gaining some control over quieting your mind can be very helpful. Of course, if you smoke, quit. When you smoke, your airways are compromised, restrict, the passage of air is diminished and oxygen intake diminished. It’s always best, at any age, to say no to cigarettes.
`}</h2>

<h2>{`Sleeping pills might help you sleep, but they can lead to dependence and have serious side effects. Your health care provider should assess the risks of daytime sleepiness, cognitive deficits, and falls before you begin taking sleep medications. It’s best to not take sleeping pills for more than 2 - 4 days a week. Again, alcohol can make the side effects of all sleeping pills worse and should be avoided.`}</h2>

<h2>{`Simple nasal decongestants can be effective in cases of snoring or mild sleep apnea. In some cases, surgery is an effective way to improve airflow through the nose. Some people snore or have sleep apnea only when sleeping on their back. So, drop a tennis ball in a sock and then pin it to the back of the pajama top. It works. My personal favorite is using deep breathing meditation techniques to get back to sleep. I love conscious, deep, slow and rhythmic deep breathing just before dropping off to a deep and sound sleep full of wonderful dreams.`}</h2>

<h2>{`Elderly women who suffer from sleep apnea are about twice as likely to develop dementia in the next five years as those without the condition, according to a multi-center study led by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco. The findings were published in the August 2011 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, and showed what sleep specialists long suspected but hadn’t proved: that sleep sleep-disorders deprive the brain and other organs of the oxygen they need and over time, may trigger declines in cognitive ability. I would assume this is true for men, too. Combine this with the fact that the elderly fear cognitive decline almost more than death itself, and it becomes a strong argument for working towards regular and better quality sleep.
Finally, two common mental health condition, bi-polar condition and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD) can lead to frequent unsettling dreams and even nightmares, which can cause very poor sleep and lead to further health deterioration.
